# Bangalore House Price Prediction

This project, developed as a part of our initial machine learning endeavors, aims to predict house prices in Bangalore. Using features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and location, we train a model to estimate house prices accurately. This helps provide valuable insights for buyers and sellers in the real estate market. The dataset includes historical house prices and various property attributes to identify key patterns affecting house values.
